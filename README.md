Installation:

The Gage parameter, type any gage you want, i.e.  10, 14 or 22 etc.. If you want
a custom thickness, then set the gage to 0 and proceed to change the thickness 
to your custom value.

Windows are defined by a tuple: 
(x position,z position,  window x size, window z size)
the x position and z position should point to the lower left corner
of the window.

If a you set a z position =0 then the program interprets it as a door.

Enjoy.
